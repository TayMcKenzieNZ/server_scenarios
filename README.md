Dear Reader,

If you are reading this message, it is likely due to your previous support of my work or a referral from an individual, such as Noor_Nahas of PopcornRP, who appears to be actively monitoring and sharing community content.

Let's be honest â€” youâ€™re probably here because you want Server Scenarios, or because PrinceAlbert is stalking my GitHub activity and has shared a URL *(possibly via Wayback Machine)* that led you to this very page. I hate to burst your bubble, but there is no Server Scenarios resource for you, PrinceAlbert, or anyone to steal and enjoy. #WompWomp

This repository serves as a public announcement to inform you that all of my content is now available on my BuyMeACoffee store.

But you're probably asking yourself, *"Why would I pay for something when there's a bunch of forks?",* Because none of these idiots know how to use codewalker and modify existing scrnarios yet alone add new ones. 

Server Scenarios was my research, and my work, not some bearded hobo who looks like he reeks of piss and bourbon.

To summarize, several individuals, including PrinceAlbert, collaborated to have me banned from FiveM and the cfx.re forums, Discord, and community. Although my suspension was initially intended to last six months, it was never lifted.

Due to my indefinite ban and the actions of individuals such as Scully, White Customs, various leaking forums, Discord servers, and Noor Nahas of PopcornRP, I have decided to place my work behind a paywall. This decision was made to prevent the unauthorized redistribution of my content and to maintain my motivation despite being unable to share my work with the community.

I have yet to find any content released by PopcornRP that is genuinely original.

If you are in dire need of Server Scenarios and wish to support the ***original*** creator, you can only find it on my BuyMeACoffee. I will also be making updates, fixes, and adding new content, which will only be available in the paid resources and not publicly distributed on GitHub where people such as PrinceAlbert can freely claim ownership.

# Frequently Asked Questions ðŸ’¬

**Q.** Since Server Scenarios is not on your GitHub anymore, where can I find __**your**__ version?

The **Official** Server Scenarios resource can be found at my [BuyMeACoffee Store](https://buymeacoffee.com/taymckenzienz/e/241532). You can also find my previously free clothing packs and more on my [ForgeHub Creator Profile](https://forge.plebmasters.de/creators/TayMcKenzieNZ).


-----------------------------------

**Q.** How does it work with the mod now being paid and getting updates?

**A.** Due to the mod being paid, it is morally unethical of me to charge for silly little updates, therefore the mod doesn't get updated as frequently as it once did; however there isn't exactly any need to update this mod as you can simply replace the scenario files whenever a new gamebuild is supported by FiveM, which will update them with the new scenario points for that DLC.


---------------------------------

**Q.** I want to make a pull request to fix something, update some natives and / or add a new feature, how can I do this?

**A:** Reach out to me via discord - taymckenzienz / TayMckenzieNZ#4886

---------------------------------

**Q.** You had a discord server. Will that ever return / Do you have a support discord?

**A.** No. That discord is long gone and I have no plans of reviving it. All of my resources are pretty straight forward to add to your server and run, ao long as you have brain cells and don't poke around touching things you clearly don't know about.


---------------------------------

**Q.** There is another unofficial mod and a bunch of forks that has XYZ features. Do you plan to add them?

**A.** Android has X, iPhone has Y, Tesla has X, Porsche Taycan has Y, BMW i4 has Z. My point is, not everything needs to be the exact same, however good luck explaining that to someone who takes 5 years of your hard work and refuses to remove any customisations and work you've done, silences you and removes your comments. Pendejo.


---------------------------------

**Q.** Your work was always open sourced and under GNU GPL V3 licensing, why are you soo hell bent?

**A.** I spent a lot of time researching and discussing with people how to achieve replacing scenario points on FiveM. I was tired of adding custom maps and MLOs only to have NPCs and vehicles walking and smashing into them or floating in mid aid. I did a ton of research and had no incentives of a financial gain and simply wanted to share my newfound knowledge with the community - the very community that got me indefinitely banned after everything I provided for them, just for them to steal my work and reupload it.

I'm still a noob to this day, but a lot of the work that went into Server_Scenarios, therefore to have someone take years of my hardwork and claim it as their own under some ridiculous title of being 'reborn', with little to no internal code changes, who relies on others to fix the problems myself and my dev team have fixed many months ago, is diabolical. This individual is **not** a developer.

A project manager *leads*; a clown entertains.
